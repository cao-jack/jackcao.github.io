description: "Quantitative Researcher at Facebook"

---

Thanks for visiting! I'm a Quantiative Researcher at Facebook in Menlo Park, California where I support the Navigation team's efforts to personalize the distribution of products to billions of users. I received my PhD in social psychology from Harvard University where I studied accuracy and error in statistical reasoning.
