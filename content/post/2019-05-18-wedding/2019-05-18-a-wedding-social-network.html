<!-- intro -->
<p>Wedding season will soon be in full swing. During cocktail hour or over the salad course at dinner, a common question that guests ask one another is how they know the happy couple. The answers that come up are localized to <em>particular individuals</em>, which means it’s difficult to get a big picture understanding of how <em>entire groups of people</em> converge to celebrate the start of a marriage.</p>
<p>Thinking about this shortly before our own wedding last April, my then-fiancee (now wife :smiley:) and I conducted a social network analysis of the guests who would celebrate with us on our special day. So we gathered a list of our 134 guests and placed their names down column A and across row 1 of an Excel spreadsheet, creating a 134 x 134 adjacency matrix. Each entry in the matrix represents if two guests had previously met in any capacity (0 = no, 1 = yes). It took us a couple hours spread over a few days to fill in the matrix, but we ended up with the following. Guests’ names are row and column labels. White squares mean the two guests hadn’t met and black squares mean they had met. Every square along the diagonal is black since guests have of course met themselves.</p>

<!-- adjacency matrix discussion -->
<p>A few things pop out about the adjacency matrix.</p>
<ul>
<li>First, it’s symmetrical. So instead of filling in all <span class="math inline">\(134^{2}\)</span> entries, we just filled in a little under half, <span class="math inline">\(\frac{134^{2} - 134}{2}\)</span>.<br />
</li>
<li>Already there’s strucutre. In the upper left corner, there’s the biggest cluster of people who’ve all met before, which is Kate’s extended family. And closer to the middle is a smaller but still sizeable cluster of people who’ve also met before, which are people in my lab.<br />
</li>
<li>The matrix is relatively sparse. Most squares are white, so lots of guests hadn’t met other guests before. This makes sense since we invited people from different parts of our lives: family from China and Chicago, classmates from New Jersey, and colleages in Boston.</li>
</ul>
