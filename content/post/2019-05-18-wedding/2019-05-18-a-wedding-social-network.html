<p>Wedding season will soon be in full swing. During cocktail hour or over the salad course at dinner, a common question that guests ask one another is how they know the happy couple. The answers that come up are localized to <em>particular individuals</em>, which means it’s difficult to get a big picture understanding of how <em>entire groups of people</em> converge to celebrate the start of a marriage.</p>
<p>Thinking about this shortly before our own wedding last April, my then-fiancee (now wife!) and I conducted a social network analysis of the guests who would celebrate with us on our special day. So we gathered a list of our 134 guests and placed their names down column A and across row 1 of an Excel spreadsheet, creating a 134 x 134 adjacency matrix. Each entry in the matrix represents if two guests had previously met in any capacity (0 = no, 1 = yes). It took us a couple hours spread over a few days to fill in the matrix, but we ended up with the following. Guests’ names are row and column labels. White squares mean the two guests hadn’t met and black squares mean they had met. Every square along the diagonal is black since guests have of course met themselves.</p>
